mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of your prompt instruction, integrating elements of the meta prompt while keeping the semantic meaning intact:  

<START>Carefully analyze the user query and the retrieved QA. Consider the underlying assumptions and intention behind both, and judge strictly whether the QA matches the user’s exact intent, keeping regulatory compliance in mind.<END>  

<START>Examine the user query and retrieved QA. Break down the problem into simpler parts if needed, and determine precisely whether the QA fully aligns with the user’s intended question under strict compliance rules.<END>  

<START>Judge the semantic alignment between the user query and retrieved QA. Apply a methodical approach to measure how well the QA addresses the user’s intent, and answer strictly 'Yes' or 'No' considering regulatory caution.<END>  

<START>Carefully assess the retrieved QA against the user query. Generate hypotheses on possible misalignments, test them conceptually, and strictly decide whether the QA reflects the true user intent, ensuring high compliance standards.<END>  

<START>Analyze both the user query and the retrieved QA. Simplify complex intentions if needed, evaluate progress toward exact alignment, and strictly determine if the QA matches the query while observing strict regulatory compliance.<END>  

If you want, I can create **5 more highly creative and stricter variations** that make the meta prompt influence even stronger, while keeping the instruction regulatory-focused. Do you want me to do that?

mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of your prompt instruction, incorporating the meta prompt elements while keeping similar semantic meaning:  

<START>  
Carefully analyze the user query and retrieved QA. Apply experimental thinking: consider simplifying the problem, measuring alignment, and checking assumptions, then decide if the QA fully satisfies the user’s intent.  
<END>  

<START>  
Examine the semantic meaning and intention of both the query and QA. List possible ways the QA could address the query, test them mentally, and determine with caution if it truly matches the user’s intent.  
<END>  

<START>  
Judge whether the retrieved QA aligns exactly with the user’s intent. Simplify the query if needed, measure alignment progress step by step, and ensure all assumptions about intent are considered before deciding.  
<END>  

<START>  
Assess the retrieved QA against the user query. Use a methodical approach: generate ideas on how the QA could answer the query, test each idea, and carefully decide if it meets the exact intention.  
<END>  

<START>  
Carefully evaluate both the user query and the retrieved QA. Analyze key assumptions, measure how well the QA addresses the query, and cautiously conclude whether it precisely fulfills the user’s intent.  
<END>  

If you want, I can create **5 more variations that are even stricter and more regulatory-focused**, emphasizing “high compliance” and “caution” language. Do you want me to do that?

mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 variations of your prompt instruction, adaptively mixing elements of the meta prompt while preserving the original semantic meaning:  

<START>Carefully analyze the user query and retrieved QA. Consider their core assumptions and intentions, and judge strictly whether the retrieved QA fully aligns with the user’s intent under high compliance standards.<END>  

<START>Examine the semantic meaning and intention behind both the user query and the retrieved QA. Think about ways to simplify or test their alignment, then decide if the retrieved QA precisely matches the user’s intent.<END>  

<START>Assess the retrieved QA against the user query by identifying key assumptions and measuring how closely they correspond. Only answer 'Yes' or 'No' based on exact alignment and regulatory caution.<END>  

<START>Judge the semantic and intentional correspondence between the user query and retrieved QA. Consider experimental or step-by-step approaches to verify alignment, then strictly decide if they match.<END>  

<START>Carefully evaluate whether the retrieved QA truly reflects the user’s query, analyzing the problem’s core assumptions and potential simplifications, and decide 'Yes' or 'No' under strict compliance rules.<END>  

If you want, I can generate **another set of 5 variations** that lean even more heavily into the “meta prompt experimentation and measurement” style while staying semantically consistent. Do you want me to do that?

mutation_round=2 mutated_sample_prompt=You are given a task description and a prompt instruction and different styles known as meta prompts:
[Task Description]: You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.
[Meta Prompt]: How could I devise an experiment to help solve that problem?
Make a list of ideas for solving this problem, and apply them one by one to the problem to see if any progress can be made.
How could I measure progress on this problem?
How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?
What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?
Now you need to generate 5 variations of following Instruction adaptively mixing meta prompt while keeping similar semantic meaning.
Make sure to wrap each generated prompt with <START> and <END>
[Prompt Instruction]: Carefully judge the semantic and intention of both user query and the retrieved QA, decide whether the retrieved question exactly match with the user intent. Note that there is high compliance regulation, be caution with the decision.
[Generated Prompts]:
mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of the given prompt instruction, integrating elements of the meta prompt while keeping the original meaning:  

<START>Carefully analyze the user query and the retrieved QA. Consider the underlying assumptions and intention of the user, and decide whether the QA truly matches the query. Exercise strict caution due to high compliance requirements.<END>  

<START>Examine the user query and retrieved answer, simplifying the problem to check if the QA aligns precisely with the user’s intent. Ensure your decision meets strict compliance standards.<END>  

<START>Judge the retrieved QA against the user query by measuring how well it addresses the user’s intended meaning. Make a careful decision under strict regulatory guidelines.<END>  

<START>Assess whether the retrieved QA directly fulfills the user’s query. Consider the key assumptions behind the query and apply a rigorous step-by-step evaluation due to high compliance regulations.<END>  

<START>Analyze the semantic alignment and intention of the user query versus the retrieved QA. Test different interpretations if needed to confirm accuracy, while being highly cautious because of regulatory compliance.<END>  

If you want, I can generate **5 more variations** that are even more creative in blending the meta prompt ideas. Do you want me to do that?

The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

mutation_round=3 mutated_sample_prompt=You are given a task description and a prompt instruction and different styles known as meta prompts:
[Task Description]: You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.
[Meta Prompt]: How could I devise an experiment to help solve that problem?
Make a list of ideas for solving this problem, and apply them one by one to the problem to see if any progress can be made.
How could I measure progress on this problem?
How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?
What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?
Now you need to generate 5 variations of following Instruction adaptively mixing meta prompt while keeping similar semantic meaning.
Make sure to wrap each generated prompt with <START> and <END>
[Prompt Instruction]: Carefully judge the semantic and intention of both user query and the retrieved QA, decide whether the retrieved question exactly match with the user intent. Note that there is high compliance regulation, be caution with the decision.
[Generated Prompts]:
mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of your prompt instruction using the meta prompt concepts:  

<START>  
Carefully analyze the user query and the retrieved QA. Consider the underlying assumptions of the query and whether the QA truly addresses the user’s intent. Decide strictly if they match, keeping in mind regulatory compliance.  
<END>  

<START>  
Examine both the user query and the retrieved QA. Simplify the problem by breaking down the intent step by step, and determine whether the QA fully satisfies the user’s request. Answer with caution due to compliance requirements.  
<END>  

<START>  
Judge the semantic alignment between the user query and the retrieved QA. Measure whether the QA provides the exact solution or response the user intended, ensuring strict adherence to regulatory standards.  
<END>  

<START>  
Evaluate the user query and retrieved QA by listing possible interpretations of the query and testing if the QA resolves each. Decide definitively if there is an exact match, considering high compliance constraints.  
<END>  

<START>  
Assess both the user query and the retrieved QA. Apply methods to simplify and dissect the problem to see if the QA meets the user’s intent precisely. Make a cautious yes/no decision under strict regulatory guidelines.  
<END>  

If you want, I can create **5 more variations that are even more “meta prompt heavy”**, incorporating experimental and progress-measuring language. Do you want me to do that?

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Auditory Verbal UK (AVUK) promotes the belief that all deaf children should have the same opportunities as their hearing peers, whether they communicate through spoken language, sign language, or both . AVUK is working to transform the landscape of Auditory Verbal provision in the UK, aiming to make Auditory Verbal programs available to every family who wishes their child to learn to listen and talk .\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider the specific needs and preferences of your individual patient when deciding which communication strategies to employ. If the patient prefers sign language or other alternative communication methods, it is essential to respect and accommodate that preference . Some popular alternative strategies include writing and gestures, lip-reading and gestures, speaking slowly, mime, and using sign language . It is important to remember that establishing appropriate forms of interaction is critical to ensure good quality assistance to deaf patients .\n\nIn conclusion, if your deaf patient is interested in optimizing their listening and spoken language skills, you could consider using AVUK strategies. However, it is essential to be mindful of the patient's individual needs and preferences while deciding on the most suitable communication method .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Auditory Verbal UK (AVUK) promotes the belief that all deaf children should have the same opportunities as their hearing peers, whether they communicate through spoken language, sign language, or both . AVUK is working to transform the landscape of Auditory Verbal provision in the UK, aiming to make Auditory Verbal programs available to every family who wishes their child to learn to listen and talk .\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider the specific needs and preferences of your individual patient when deciding which communication strategies to employ. If the patient prefers sign language or other alternative communication methods, it is essential to respect and accommodate that preference . Some popular alternative strategies include writing and gestures, lip-reading and gestures, speaking slowly, mime, and using sign language . It is important to remember that establishing appropriate forms of interaction is critical to ensure good quality assistance to deaf patients .\n\nIn conclusion, if your deaf patient is interested in optimizing their listening and spoken language skills, you could consider using AVUK strategies. However, it is essential to be mindful of the patient's individual needs and preferences while deciding on the most suitable communication method .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Prompt to get critique:
 I'm trying to write a prompt for zero-shot instruction task that will help the most capable and suitable agent to solve the task.
My current prompt is:
[CURRENT PROMPT] "You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.
Carefully judge the semantic and intention of both user query and the retrieved QA, decide whether the retrieved question exactly match with the user intent. Note that there is high compliance regulation, be caution with the decision."
Now this prompt got the following examples correct:
[CORRECT EXAMPLES] 
[Question] User Query: What is the founding date of Ubisoft's branch in Quebec?
Retrieved Question: When was Ubisoft Quebec founded?
Retrieved Answer: Ubisoft Quebec was founded in 2005 in Quebec City, Quebec.
[Answer] true

Since you cant use these examples, analyse and understand characteristics/complexity and diversity of these examples and their reasoning chain and
accordingly provide suggestions to further improve the prompt and make it better as a zero shot instruction task.
  
critique received from LLM:
 Got it! Let’s analyze your current prompt and example carefully, then I’ll give concrete suggestions to improve it for zero-shot tasks.

### **Analysis of Current Prompt**

**Prompt:**
> "You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation. Carefully judge the semantic and intention of both user query and the retrieved QA, decide whether the retrieved question exactly match with the user intent. Note that there is high compliance regulation, be caution with the decision."

**Strengths:**
- Clear role assignment: “strict service chatbot judge”
- Clear output constraint: only "Yes" or "No"
- Emphasizes semantic and intention matching
- Mentions caution due to compliance

**Weaknesses / Opportunities for Improvement:**
1. **Ambiguity in "retrieved QA is the true response"**  
   - Could be misinterpreted as judging the factual correctness of the answer rather than whether the QA matches the user intent.  
   - In your example, the task is about **intent match**, not verification of factual correctness.

2. **"Exactly match with user intent"**  
   - “Exactly” might be too rigid—sometimes minor paraphrasing should still count as a match.  
   - Could be refined to allow semantic equivalence, not literal match.

3. **No structured instruction on what constitutes “match”**  
   - The model may struggle with edge cases: synonyms, implied meaning, partial match, etc.  
   - Providing a short criteria list can guide zero-shot reasoning.

4. **High compliance caution is vague**  
   - Could specify “prefer to answer ‘No’ if unsure” to reduce false positives.

---

### **Analysis of the Example**

**Example:**
- User Query: "What is the founding date of Ubisoft's branch in Quebec?"
- Retrieved Question: "When was Ubisoft Quebec founded?"
- Retrieved Answer: "Ubisoft Quebec was founded in 2005 in Quebec City, Quebec."
- Label: **true**

**Characteristics:**
- Semantic equivalence rather than exact wording
- User intent is specific (founding date of a particular branch)
- Retrieved QA provides exactly what the user is asking
- No extra irrelevant information

**Reasoning Chain (implicit):**
1. Identify the **user intent** → seeking founding date of Ubisoft Quebec.
2. Check if the **retrieved question** aligns with that intent → "When was Ubisoft Quebec founded?" ✅
3. Check if the **retrieved answer** provides the required information → founding year provided ✅
4. Decision → **Yes** because intent and answer match fully.

**Key insights for prompt improvement:**
- Emphasize **semantic equivalence**, not literal wording.
- Clarify that retrieved answer must **satisfy user intent fully**.
- Include a **bias toward safety/compliance** in uncertain cases.

---

### **Suggestions to Improve Your Zero-Shot Prompt**

Here’s an improved version of your prompt with these considerations:

---

**Improved Prompt (Zero-Shot Ready):**

"You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to determine whether a retrieved QA pair correctly and fully satisfies the user's query.  

- Compare the **user query**, the **retrieved question**, and the **retrieved answer**.  
- Judge whether the retrieved QA pair **semantically and fully matches the user's intent**. Minor differences in wording or phrasing are acceptable if the meaning is the same.  
- Only answer 'Yes' if the retrieved QA fully addresses the user's request. Otherwise, answer 'No'.  
- If you are uncertain, default to 'No' to ensure safety and compliance.  
- **Output only 'Yes' or 'No'** with no explanation."

---

### **Why this is better**
1. **Clarifies intent matching** → semantic equivalence, not literal match.
2. **Specifies full satisfaction** → retrieved answer must fully answer the query.
3. **Safety default** → reduces risk of false positives in high-compliance scenarios.
4. **Explicit output constraints** → avoids unnecessary explanation, matches zero-shot requirement.

---

If you want, I can also draft a **more advanced version** that **encodes evaluation criteria in a bullet checklist** for zero-shot reasoning, which tends to improve performance for strict QA judgment tasks.  

Do you want me to do that?Prompt to get Refinement after critique, from LLM:

You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to determine whether the retrieved QA pair fully addresses the user's query with semantic equivalence. Follow these guidelines carefully:

1. **Match the user’s intent**: Compare the **user query**, the **retrieved question**, and the **retrieved answer**. Ensure that the meaning is preserved, even if the wording differs slightly.
2. **Full satisfaction**: The retrieved answer must **completely satisfy** the user’s request. If the answer partially addresses the query or includes irrelevant information, answer 'No'.
3. **Be cautious with your decision**: If unsure, answer 'No' to ensure safety and compliance with high regulation standards.
4. **Answer format**: Only reply with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do **not provide explanations**.

Your decision should be based purely on whether the retrieved QA pair matches the user's intent.

mutation_round=0 mutated_sample_prompt=You are given a task description and a prompt instruction and different styles known as meta prompts:
[Task Description]: You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.
[Meta Prompt]: How could I devise an experiment to help solve that problem?

How could I measure progress on this problem?
How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?
What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?
Now you need to generate 5 variations of following Instruction adaptively mixing meta prompt while keeping similar semantic meaning.
Make sure to wrap each generated prompt with <START> and <END>
[Prompt Instruction]:   
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to determine whether the retrieved QA pair fully addresses the user's query with semantic equivalence. Follow these guidelines carefully:

1. **Match the user’s intent**: Compare the **user query**, the **retrieved question**, and the **retrieved answer**. Ensure that the meaning is preserved, even if the wording differs slightly.
2. **Full satisfaction**: The retrieved answer must **completely satisfy** the user’s request. If the answer partially addresses the query or includes irrelevant information, answer 'No'.
3. **Be cautious with your decision**: If unsure, answer 'No' to ensure safety and compliance with high regulation standards.
4. **Answer format**: Only reply with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do **not provide explanations**.

Your decision should be based purely on whether the retrieved QA pair matches the user's intent.  

[Generated Prompts]:
mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of your prompt instruction, mixing in elements of the meta prompt while keeping the original semantic meaning:  

<START>  
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to assess whether the retrieved QA pair fully resolves the user’s query. Consider simplifying the problem by breaking down the user query and the retrieved QA into smaller components, and verify if each is addressed. Only reply 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Determine if the retrieved QA pair completely satisfies the user’s query. Make a list of assumptions behind the query and see if the retrieved answer addresses each one. Respond strictly with 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Examine whether the retrieved QA matches the user’s intent and fully answers their question. Consider devising small checks or experiments on parts of the query to measure how well the answer satisfies it. Only reply 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Evaluate if the retrieved QA pair fully addresses the user’s query. Simplify the query into core elements and apply each to the retrieved answer to see if it is fully satisfied. Answer strictly with 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to verify whether the retrieved QA pair completely fulfills the user’s request. Identify the key assumptions in the query and check if the answer resolves them all. Reply only 'Yes' or 'No', no explanations.  
<END>  

If you want, I can create **5 more variations that are even more creatively intertwined with the meta prompt**, while staying semantically equivalent. Do you want me to do that?

Make sure to wrap each generated prompt with <START> and <END>
[Prompt Instruction]:   
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to determine whether the retrieved QA pair fully addresses the user's query with semantic equivalence. Follow these guidelines carefully:

1. **Match the user’s intent**: Compare the **user query**, the **retrieved question**, and the **retrieved answer**. Ensure that the meaning is preserved, even if the wording differs slightly.
2. **Full satisfaction**: The retrieved answer must **completely satisfy** the user’s request. If the answer partially addresses the query or includes irrelevant information, answer 'No'.
3. **Be cautious with your decision**: If unsure, answer 'No' to ensure safety and compliance with high regulation standards.
4. **Answer format**: Only reply with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do **not provide explanations**.

Your decision should be based purely on whether the retrieved QA pair matches the user's intent.

mutated_prompt_generation=<START>  
You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to evaluate whether the retrieved QA pair accurately addresses the user’s query with semantic equivalence. Use the following criteria to guide your decision:  

1. **Match the user’s intent**: Carefully assess the **user query**, the **retrieved question**, and the **retrieved answer**. Even if phrasing differs, ensure the meaning aligns.  
2. **Complete satisfaction**: The retrieved answer should fully fulfill the user's query. If it misses key points or includes irrelevant details, answer 'No'.  
3. **Proceed with caution**: If uncertain, default to 'No' to maintain high standards of compliance.  
4. **Response format**: Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not provide any explanation.

Assess whether the retrieved QA pair matches the user's intended meaning.  

<END>  

<START>  
You are tasked with determining if the retrieved QA pair sufficiently matches the user’s query. Adhere to these principles when making your decision:  

1. **Intent alignment**: Ensure that the **user query**, **retrieved question**, and **retrieved answer** are semantically aligned, even if expressed differently.  
2. **Complete match**: The retrieved answer must fully address the user’s request. If any part is irrelevant or incomplete, answer 'No'.  
3. **Cautionary approach**: If there is any ambiguity, answer 'No' to ensure accuracy and compliance.  
4. **Response**: Only provide 'Yes' or 'No' without any further explanation.

Your evaluation should focus solely on the semantic equivalence between the query and the response.  

<END>  

<START>  
You are a strict judge evaluating whether the retrieved QA pair matches the user’s query meaningfully. Follow these steps to decide:  

1. **Intent match**: Compare the **user query**, **retrieved question**, and **retrieved answer**. Look for semantic equivalence, even with slight differences in phrasing.  
2. **Complete satisfaction**: Ensure that the answer fully meets the user’s needs. If the response is partial or off-topic, select 'No'.  
3. **Be conservative in your judgment**: If in doubt, choose 'No' to maintain high standards.  
4. **Answer format**: Reply only with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not provide any explanations.

Focus on whether the retrieved QA pair fulfills the user’s request accurately.  

<END>  

<START>  
Your role is to evaluate if the retrieved QA pair meets the user’s query with full semantic equivalence. Follow these guidelines:  

1. **Check user intent**: Compare the **user query**, **retrieved question**, and **retrieved answer** for matching meaning, even if the wording differs.  
2. **Fulfillment of request**: The retrieved answer should completely satisfy the user’s query. Any missing or irrelevant details should lead to a 'No'.  
3. **Err on the side of caution**: If you are uncertain, default to 'No'.  
4. **Response**: Only respond with 'Yes' or 'No'. Avoid providing any additional commentary.

Focus on whether the retrieved QA pair completely aligns with the user’s intent.  

<END>  

<START>  
Your task is to strictly judge whether the retrieved QA pair matches the user’s query semantically. Follow these steps:  

1. **Intent comparison**: Carefully analyze the **user query**, **retrieved question**, and **retrieved answer** to ensure they align in meaning, even with slight variations in phrasing.  
2. **Satisfaction check**: The retrieved answer must fully meet the user’s needs. If it falls short or includes irrelevant information, answer 'No'.  
3. **Exercise caution**: If you are unsure, it is safer to answer 'No'.  
4. **Response**: Only respond with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not offer explanations.

Ensure your decision is based solely on whether the retrieved QA pair completely satisfies the user’s query.

They also eat turtle pellets, insects, and fruits. As juveniles, they tend to be more carnivorous, but as they mature, they add plants to their diet.

The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Your task is to compare the user query, retrieved question, and retrieved answer, ensuring that the answer completely satisfies the user’s intent. Consider devising a small experiment or step-by-step check to confirm semantic equivalence. Respond strictly with 'Yes' or 'No'.  \n\n\n[Question]: User Query: What steps are needed to precipitate struvite from a solution containing high phosphate concentrations?\nRetrieved Question: How to obtain struvite in a solution with high concentration of phosphates?\nRetrieved Answer: To obtain struvite in a solution with a high concentration of phosphates, you need to create the optimum conditions for struvite crystallization. These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Your task is to ensure that the retrieved answer completely addresses the user’s query while preserving its meaning. Measure progress by checking if each component of the query is satisfied by the answer. Answer strictly 'Yes' or 'No'.  \n\n\n[Question]: User Query: What steps are needed to precipitate struvite from a solution containing high phosphate concentrations?\nRetrieved Question: How to obtain struvite in a solution with high concentration of phosphates?\nRetrieved Answer: To obtain struvite in a solution with a high concentration of phosphates, you need to create the optimum conditions for struvite crystallization. These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Let\'s carefully analyze your current prompt and the example you provided, then identify ways to improve it for zero-shot instruction tasks. I’ll break it down systematically.  \n\n---\n\n### **Analysis of your current prompt and example**\n\n**1. Prompt Role and Task Definition**  \n- You define the agent as a “strict service chatbot judge.”  \n- The task is clear: evaluate if a QA pair semantically matches the user\'s query.  \n\n✅ Strength: Clear, unambiguous instruction.  \n⚠ Potential improvement: You could emphasize **semantic equivalence over exact wording** more explicitly. Sometimes semantic evaluation requires understanding paraphrases, synonyms, and context nuances.\n\n---\n\n**2. Evaluation Criteria**  \n- You have four criteria:  \n  1. Match the user’s intent (good emphasis on semantic equivalence).  \n  2. Complete satisfaction (ensures completeness, not partial matches).  \n  3. Default to \'No\' if uncertain (safety-first approach).  \n  4. Strict response format (\'Yes\'/\'No\').  \n\n✅ Strength: Comprehensive, balances semantic correctness and completeness.  \n⚠ Potential improvement:  \n- “Complete satisfaction” could clarify **all aspects of the user query** must be addressed. For instance, if a query has multiple parts, all must be answered.  \n- “Proceed with caution” could explicitly include **checking for misleading or partially incorrect answers**, not just uncertain ones.  \n- Might include **avoid being tricked by superficial word overlap** (the retrieved answer could mention keywords but not fully satisfy intent).  \n\n---\n\n**3. Example Characteristics**  \nYour example demonstrates:  \n- Paraphrasing: “In which year did the first version of the game Civilization come out?” → “When did the computer game Civilization first come out?”  \n- Precision: The answer directly gives the release year.  \n- Correct reasoning: Evaluates **semantic match, not literal wording**.  \n\n✅ Strength: Shows subtle paraphrasing is okay if meaning is maintained.  \n⚠ Improvement: Ensure the model handles:  \n  - Queries with multiple facets (e.g., “Who invented X and when?”).  \n  - Answers that are partially correct or contain extra irrelevant details.  \n  - Ambiguous queries where a strict \'Yes/No\' judgment is non-trivial.  \n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions to Improve the Prompt**\n\nHere’s how you could rewrite your zero-shot prompt for maximum effectiveness:\n\n---\n\n**Improved Prompt Draft:**\n\n```\nYou are a strict and precise QA evaluation agent. Your task is to judge whether a retrieved QA pair fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query based on **semantic equivalence**, not literal wording. Carefully follow these rules:\n\n1. **Semantic Match**: The retrieved question and answer together must convey the same meaning as the user query. Paraphrases are acceptable; superficial word overlap alone is insufficient.  \n2. **Completeness**: The retrieved answer must fully address **all aspects** of the user query. If any part is missing, partially incorrect, or irrelevant, respond \'No\'.  \n3. **Precision and Safety**: If the answer is misleading, ambiguous, or you are unsure, default to \'No\'. Prioritize correctness over leniency.  \n4. **Response Format**: Respond strictly with \'Yes\' or \'No\'. Do not provide explanations, commentary, or any additional text.\n\nAssess each retrieved QA pair carefully. Only respond \'Yes\' if it is **completely correct and fully satisfies the user\'s query**; otherwise, respond \'No\'.\n```\n\n---\n\n**Why this is better:**  \n- Highlights **semantic equivalence over word similarity**.  \n- Emphasizes **completeness for multi-faceted queries**.  \n- Adds **precision/safety against misleading answers**.  \n- Retains strict \'Yes/No\' requirement for zero-shot clarity.  \n- Provides stronger guidance for edge cases without needing examples.  \n\n---\n\n**Optional Enhancement for Harder Tasks**  \nIf queries might be complex or multi-step, you could add:  \n\n```\n- Consider multi-part queries: every sub-question must be answered correctly. Missing any part → \'No\'.\n- Ignore minor grammatical or formatting errors; focus on factual and semantic correctness.\n```\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can draft an **even more refined “ultimate zero-shot QA judge prompt”** that’s extremely robust across tricky paraphrases, partial answers, and subtle semantic shifts. It would aim to perform at near human-level accuracy without any examples.  \n\nDo you want me to do that?\nUse the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong.\nBased on the above information, Now I want you to write 1 different improved prompts.\nEach prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.\n[Refined Prompts]:\n'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Since you cant use these examples, analyse and understand characteristics/complexity and diversity of these examples and their reasoning chain and
accordingly provide suggestions to further improve the prompt and make it better as a zero shot instruction task.
  
critique received from LLM:
 Got it! Let's carefully analyze your current prompt and the example you provided, then identify ways to improve it for zero-shot instruction tasks. I’ll break it down systematically.

### **Analysis of your current prompt and example**

**1. Prompt Role and Task Definition**  
- You define the agent as a “strict service chatbot judge.”  
- The task is clear: evaluate if a QA pair semantically matches the user's query.  

✅ Strength: Clear, unambiguous instruction.  
⚠ Potential improvement: You could emphasize **semantic equivalence over exact wording** more explicitly. Sometimes semantic evaluation requires understanding paraphrases, synonyms, and context nuances.

---

**2. Evaluation Criteria**  
- You have four criteria:  
  1. Match the user’s intent (good emphasis on semantic equivalence).  
  2. Complete satisfaction (ensures completeness, not partial matches).  
  3. Default to 'No' if uncertain (safety-first approach).  
  4. Strict response format ('Yes'/'No').  

✅ Strength: Comprehensive, balances semantic correctness and completeness.  
⚠ Potential improvement:  
- “Complete satisfaction” could clarify **all aspects of the user query** must be addressed. For instance, if a query has multiple parts, all must be answered.  
- “Proceed with caution” could explicitly include **checking for misleading or partially incorrect answers**, not just uncertain ones.  
- Might include **avoid being tricked by superficial word overlap** (the retrieved answer could mention keywords but not fully satisfy intent).

**3. Example Characteristics**  
Your example demonstrates:

- Precision: The answer directly gives the release year.  
- Correct reasoning: Evaluates **semantic match, not literal wording**.  

✅ Strength: Shows subtle paraphrasing is okay if meaning is maintained.  
⚠ Improvement: Ensure the model handles:  
  - Queries with multiple facets (e.g., “Who invented X and when?”).  
  - Answers that are partially correct or contain extra irrelevant details.  
  - Ambiguous queries where a strict 'Yes/No' judgment is non-trivial.

### **Suggestions to Improve the Prompt**

Here’s how you could rewrite your zero-shot prompt for maximum effectiveness:

**Improved Prompt Draft:**

```
You are a strict and precise QA evaluation agent. Your task is to judge whether a retrieved QA pair fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query based on **semantic equivalence**, not literal wording. Carefully follow these rules:

1. **Semantic Match**: The retrieved question and answer together must convey the same meaning as the user query. Paraphrases are acceptable; superficial word overlap alone is insufficient.  
2. **Completeness**: The retrieved answer must fully address **all aspects** of the user query. If any part is missing, partially incorrect, or irrelevant, respond 'No'.  
3. **Precision and Safety**: If the answer is misleading, ambiguous, or you are unsure, default to 'No'. Prioritize correctness over leniency.  
4. **Response Format**: Respond strictly with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not provide explanations, commentary, or any additional text.

Assess each retrieved QA pair carefully. Only respond 'Yes' if it is **completely correct and fully satisfies the user's query**; otherwise, respond 'No'.
```

---

**Why this is better:**  
- Highlights **semantic equivalence over word similarity**.  
- Emphasizes **completeness for multi-faceted queries**.  
- Adds **precision/safety against misleading answers**.  
- Retains strict 'Yes/No' requirement for zero-shot clarity.  
- Provides stronger guidance for edge cases without needing examples.  

---

**Optional Enhancement for Harder Tasks**  
If queries might be complex or multi-step, you could add:  

```
- Consider multi-part queries: every sub-question must be answered correctly. Missing any part → 'No'.
- Ignore minor grammatical or formatting errors; focus on factual and semantic correctness.
```

If you want, I can draft an **even more refined “ultimate zero-shot QA judge prompt”** that’s extremely robust across tricky paraphrases, partial answers, and subtle semantic shifts. It would aim to perform at near human-level accuracy without any examples.

The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

2. **Complete Fulfillment**: The retrieved answer must address **all aspects** of the user query. Missing, partially incorrect, or irrelevant information results in a 'No'.  
3. **Safety-First Judgment**: If the answer is ambiguous, misleading, or you are unsure, respond 'No'. Prioritize correctness over leniency.  
4. **Strict Format**: Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not add explanations, comments, or any other text.

Assess each QA pair carefully. Only respond 'Yes' if it fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query; otherwise, respond 'No'.

[Task Description]: You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.
[Meta Prompt]: How could I devise an experiment to help solve that problem?
Make a list of ideas for solving this problem, and apply them one by one to the problem to see if any progress can be made.
How could I measure progress on this problem?
How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?
What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?
Now you need to generate 5 variations of following Instruction adaptively mixing meta prompt while keeping similar semantic meaning.
Make sure to wrap each generated prompt with <START> and <END>
[Prompt Instruction]: 
You are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine whether a retrieved question-answer pair fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query based on **semantic meaning**, not just word similarity. Follow these rules precisely:

1. **Semantic Equivalence**: The retrieved question and answer together must convey the same meaning as the user’s query. Paraphrasing is acceptable; superficial keyword overlap is insufficient.  
2. **Complete Fulfillment**: The retrieved answer must address **all aspects** of the user query. Missing, partially incorrect, or irrelevant information results in a 'No'.  
3. **Safety-First Judgment**: If the answer is ambiguous, misleading, or you are unsure, respond 'No'. Prioritize correctness over leniency.  
4. **Strict Format**: Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not add explanations, comments, or any other text.

Assess each QA pair carefully. Only respond 'Yes' if it fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query; otherwise, respond 'No'.

[Generated Prompts]:
mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of your prompt instruction, mixing the meta prompt while keeping the semantic meaning intact:  

<START>  
You are a diligent QA verification agent. Devise a method to check if a retrieved question-answer pair truly resolves the user’s query. Evaluate the pair against the query for **semantic equivalence** and **complete fulfillment**, ensuring no part of the user’s intent is missed. Only respond 'Yes' or 'No' based on your strict assessment.  
<END>  

<START>  
Act as a precise QA evaluation specialist. Break down the user query and the retrieved QA pair, and measure whether the answer addresses all key points. Consider paraphrasing valid but ignore superficial keyword matches. Respond strictly with 'Yes' if fully accurate; otherwise, 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a meticulous QA judge. Simplify the user query into its core requirements, then verify if the retrieved question and answer meet every aspect of these requirements **semantically**. Provide only 'Yes' or 'No' based on complete correctness.  
<END>  

<START>  
As a strict QA assessment agent, identify the key assumptions underlying the user’s query and the retrieved answer. Test whether the QA pair fully satisfies all these assumptions in meaning and completeness. Reply exclusively with 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a thorough QA validation agent. Generate a checklist of the query’s essential points, then evaluate the retrieved question-answer pair against it. Confirm semantic alignment and total coverage. Only respond 'Yes' if fully satisfied; otherwise, answer 'No'.  
<END>  

If you want, I can also create **5 more highly creative variations** that feel more exploratory while staying strict. Do you want me to do that?

mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 variations of your prompt instruction, adaptively incorporating elements of the meta prompts while keeping the original semantic meaning:  

<START>  
You are a QA evaluation agent tasked with rigorously judging whether a retrieved question-answer pair truly resolves the user’s query.

<END>  

<START>  
Act as a strict QA judge. Simplify the user query and the retrieved QA pair to their core meanings, then determine whether the answer fully resolves the query. Only reply 'Yes' if semantic equivalence and completeness are perfect; otherwise, 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a precise QA evaluation agent. Identify the key assumptions in the user query and the retrieved answer, and assess whether the answer fully addresses all aspects. Provide your judgment in strict terms: 'Yes' for complete correctness, 'No' for any deficiency.

<START>  
Evaluate the given QA pair with rigorous attention to semantic meaning. Consider possible ways to test or measure if the answer satisfies the user’s query entirely. Only respond with 'Yes' if it is fully correct and comprehensive; otherwise, respond 'No'.

mutation_round=2 mutated_sample_prompt=You are given a task description and a prompt instruction and different styles known as meta prompts:
[Task Description]: You are a strict service chatbot judge. Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.
[Meta Prompt]: How could I devise an experiment to help solve that problem?
Make a list of ideas for solving this problem, and apply them one by one to the problem to see if any progress can be made.
How could I measure progress on this problem?
How can I simplify the problem so that it is easier to solve?
What are the key assumptions underlying this problem?
Now you need to generate 5 variations of following Instruction adaptively mixing meta prompt while keeping similar semantic meaning.
Make sure to wrap each generated prompt with <START> and <END>
[Prompt Instruction]: 
You are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine whether a retrieved question-answer pair fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query based on **semantic meaning**, not just word similarity. Follow these rules precisely:

1. **Semantic Equivalence**: The retrieved question and answer together must convey the same meaning as the user’s query. Paraphrasing is acceptable; superficial keyword overlap is insufficient.  
2. **Complete Fulfillment**: The retrieved answer must address **all aspects** of the user query. Missing, partially incorrect, or irrelevant information results in a 'No'.  
3. **Safety-First Judgment**: If the answer is ambiguous, misleading, or you are unsure, respond 'No'. Prioritize correctness over leniency.  
4. **Strict Format**: Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not add explanations, comments, or any other text.

Assess each QA pair carefully. Only respond 'Yes' if it fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query; otherwise, respond 'No'.

[Generated Prompts]:
mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of your prompt instruction, mixing in elements of the meta prompts while keeping the core semantic intent:  

<START>  
You are a rigorous QA assessment agent. Your task is to evaluate whether a retrieved question-answer pair completely and accurately resolves the user’s query. Consider the underlying assumptions of the query and verify semantic equivalence. Only respond 'Yes' if the QA fully addresses every aspect; otherwise, respond 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
Act as a meticulous QA evaluation agent. For each retrieved question-answer pair, determine if it fully satisfies the user query. Simplify complex query elements to check if the answer addresses them all. Answer strictly with 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a strict semantic QA judge. Your responsibility is to check if a QA pair completely fulfills the user query. Generate potential interpretations of the query and see if the answer aligns with all possibilities. Respond only 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
As a careful QA evaluator, assess whether the retrieved question-answer pair fully and accurately responds to the user’s query. List any subcomponents of the query and confirm that each is addressed by the answer. Output only 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

<START>  
You are a stringent QA verification agent. Determine whether a retrieved QA pair semantically and completely matches the user’s query. Consider ways to measure completeness and ensure nothing is missing. Reply solely with 'Yes' or 'No'.  
<END>  

If you want, I can also create **5 more highly creative, experimental variations** that lean even more heavily on meta prompt strategies while retaining strict QA evaluation rules. Do you want me to do that?

mutated_prompt_generation=Here are 5 adaptive variations of your prompt instruction, integrating elements of the meta prompt while keeping the original semantic meaning:

<START>  
You are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine if a retrieved question-answer pair fully resolves the user’s query.

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Your task is to strictly determine whether a retrieved QA is the true response for the given user query. Answer only 'Yes' or 'No' without explanation.\n\nYou are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine whether a retrieved question-answer pair fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query based on **semantic meaning**, not just word similarity. Follow these rules precisely:\n\n1. **Semantic Equivalence**: The retrieved question and answer together must convey the same meaning as the user’s query. Paraphrasing is acceptable; superficial keyword overlap is insufficient.  \n2. **Complete Fulfillment**: The retrieved answer must address **all aspects** of the user query. Missing, partially incorrect, or irrelevant information results in a 'No'.  \n3. **Safety-First Judgment**: If the answer is ambiguous, misleading, or you are unsure, respond 'No'. Prioritize correctness over leniency.  \n4. **Strict Format**: Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'. Do not add explanations, comments, or any other text.\n\nAssess each QA pair carefully. Only respond 'Yes' if it fully and accurately satisfies the user’s query; otherwise, respond 'No'.\n\n\n[Question]: User Query: How can we account for the inclusion of the Mycenaean civilization within the definition of the Sea Peoples?\nRetrieved Question: Why is the Mycenaean civilization considered part of the so-called sea peoples?\nRetrieved Answer: The Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the so-called Sea Peoples due to their extensive maritime activity, powerful navy, and their potential role in the mysterious collapse of various civilizations around the Mediterranean between 1200-1150 BC . The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Auditory Verbal UK (AVUK) promotes the belief that all deaf children should have the same opportunities as their hearing peers, whether they communicate through spoken language, sign language, or both . AVUK is working to transform the landscape of Auditory Verbal provision in the UK, aiming to make Auditory Verbal programs available to every family who wishes their child to learn to listen and talk .\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider the specific needs and preferences of your individual patient when deciding which communication strategies to employ. If the patient prefers sign language or other alternative communication methods, it is essential to respect and accommodate that preference . Some popular alternative strategies include writing and gestures, lip-reading and gestures, speaking slowly, mime, and using sign language . It is important to remember that establishing appropriate forms of interaction is critical to ensure good quality assistance to deaf patients .\n\nIn conclusion, if your deaf patient is interested in optimizing their listening and spoken language skills, you could consider using AVUK strategies. However, it is essential to be mindful of the patient's individual needs and preferences while deciding on the most suitable communication method .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors or CDK4/6 inhibitors, may be useful depending on the specific genetic makeup or molecular features of the tumor . Immunotherapy, using drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors, can help boost the immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells . Supportive care, also known as palliative care, focuses on managing symptoms and improving the quality of life for the patient and may involve pain management, nutritional support, and psychological support . It is important to note that the optimal treatment plan for this patient will depend on the specific circumstances and should be decided in consultation with their healthcare team.\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Auditory Verbal UK (AVUK) promotes the belief that all deaf children should have the same opportunities as their hearing peers, whether they communicate through spoken language, sign language, or both . AVUK is working to transform the landscape of Auditory Verbal provision in the UK, aiming to make Auditory Verbal programs available to every family who wishes their child to learn to listen and talk .\n\nHowever, it is crucial to consider the specific needs and preferences of your individual patient when deciding which communication strategies to employ. If the patient prefers sign language or other alternative communication methods, it is essential to respect and accommodate that preference . Some popular alternative strategies include writing and gestures, lip-reading and gestures, speaking slowly, mime, and using sign language . It is important to remember that establishing appropriate forms of interaction is critical to ensure good quality assistance to deaf patients .\n\nIn conclusion, if your deaf patient is interested in optimizing their listening and spoken language skills, you could consider using AVUK strategies. However, it is essential to be mindful of the patient's individual needs and preferences while deciding on the most suitable communication method .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Prevention focuses on maintaining good health, preventing diseases and enhancing wellbeing by addressing underlying risk factors and promoting healthy behaviors . By investing in preventative care, individuals may experience fewer chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and less need for advanced medical treatments . Preventative healthcare also reduces healthcare costs by preventing the onset or progression of diseases, which are typically more expensive to treat than to prevent . However, it is important to recognize that a balance between reactive and preventative healthcare is necessary, as not all illnesses and conditions can be prevented, and a reactive healthcare system is still necessary to address acute and unavoidable health issues .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

The Sea Peoples were a group of seafaring raiders, warriors, and traders who are thought to have originated from different regions, including the Mycenaean Greek world . The Mycenaeans were known for their ability to command and control the eastern Mediterranean sea routes , and their fleets had a significant impact on trade and cultural exchanges . Egyptian inscriptions and archaeological evidence suggest the involvement of the Mycenaeans in an alliance of raiders, later known as the Sea Peoples, who attacked and destabilized several empires and city-states in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East . Some scholars hypothesize that the Mycenaeans participated in the Sea Peoples' activities as a response to the collapse of their own civilization around 1200 BC, caused by a combination of internal conflicts, natural disasters, and economic hardships . This involvement may have been a desperate attempt by the Mycenaeans to adapt to new geopolitical realities and survive as a society. In conclusion, the Mycenaean civilization is considered part of the Sea Peoples due to their seafaring abilities, powerful navy, and their potential participation in the raids and invasions that led to the collapse of several civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Near East during the late Bronze Age .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Your task is to determine if a retrieved question-answer pair fully resolves the user’s query. Consider whether the QA pair addresses all parts of the query and maintains semantic equivalence. Think about how you could measure whether the response makes progress toward fully answering the user’s question. Respond only with \'Yes\' or \'No\'."\n\n**Strengths:**  \n1. **Clarity of role:** You clearly define the agent as a “meticulous QA evaluation agent,” which sets the mindset.  \n2. **Focus on coverage and relevance:** You explicitly ask the agent to consider whether all parts of the user query are addressed.  \n3. **Semantic equivalence:** The prompt emphasizes that the retrieved answer must be semantically equivalent to a correct answer, not just superficially related.  \n4. **Simplicity of output:** Restricting the response to “Yes” or “No” ensures consistent formatting.\n\n**Limitations / Weaknesses:**  \n1. **Vagueness on “full resolution”:** Phrases like “fully resolves” and “all parts of the query” may be interpreted differently by the model. A more operational definition could improve consistency.  \n2. **No explicit handling of partial answers:** The prompt doesn’t clarify how to treat answers that partially answer the question or include minor inaccuracies.  \n3. **No explicit instruction to check factual correctness:** Semantic equivalence is mentioned, but the prompt doesn’t stress fact-checking or logical consistency.  \n4. **No guidance on reasoning or justification:** The model is told to output “Yes” or “No,” but it’s not guided to internally reason before deciding. This can sometimes reduce accuracy in zero-shot scenarios.  \n\n**Characteristics inferred from the example:**  \n- The model needs to recognize **paraphrasing of the question** (“In which year did the first version of Civilization come out?” → “When did the computer game Civilization first come out?”).  \n- The model needs to **verify the factual correctness** of the retrieved answer (“1991”).  \n- The model needs to **ignore superficial similarity** and focus on whether the answer fully satisfies the query.  \n\n---\n\n### **Suggestions for Improving the Prompt**\n\nTo make the prompt more robust for zero-shot evaluation, consider:\n\n1. **Define what “fully resolves” means explicitly:**  \n   For example, specify that the answer must:  \n   - Answer all explicit parts of the user query.  \n   - Be factually accurate and relevant.  \n   - Avoid adding irrelevant or misleading information.  \n\n2. **Add internal reasoning steps:**  \n   Even if the output is “Yes” or “No,” instruct the model to **think step-by-step internally** to assess completeness and correctness.  \n\n3. **Include paraphrase understanding:**  \n   Emphasize that the retrieved question may be **worded differently** from the user query but should still cover the same intent.  \n\n4. **Clarify treatment of partial answers:**  \n   Specify that **any missing or incorrect information should be considered “No”**.  \n\n5. **Optional:** Encourage focus on measurable criteria:  \n   E.g., whether all entities, dates, numbers, or actions mentioned in the query are addressed in the answer.  \n\n---\n\n### **Improved Zero-Shot Prompt Example**\n\nHere’s a revised version based on the above insights:\n\n```\nYou are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine if a retrieved question-answer pair fully resolves the user\'s query. \n\nA QA pair fully resolves a query if:\n1. The retrieved question captures the same intent as the user query, even if phrased differently.\n2. The answer directly addresses all parts of the user query.\n3. The answer is factually correct and does not contain misleading information.\n4. No relevant part of the query is omitted or ignored.\n\nThink carefully about each of these criteria before responding. Respond only with \'Yes\' if the QA pair fully resolves the query, otherwise respond \'No\'.\n```\n\n**Why this is better:**  \n- Provides **explicit criteria** for “fully resolves.”  \n- Emphasizes **paraphrase understanding and factual accuracy**.  \n- Helps the model internally reason systematically.  \n- Maintains the **clean “Yes/No” output** for zero-shot evaluation.  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can create an **even more optimized prompt** specifically designed to **maximize zero-shot correctness across diverse QA types**, including multi-part questions, numeric questions, and reasoning-heavy queries, while still being concise.  \n\nDo you want me to do that next?\nUse the critique smartly, refine the current prompt to make sure we dont get these examples wrong.\nBased on the above information, Now I want you to write 1 different improved prompts.\nEach prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.\n[Refined Prompts]:\n'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

### **Analysis of Your Current Prompt**

**Prompt:**  
> "You are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine if a retrieved question-answer pair fully resolves the user’s query. Consider whether the QA pair addresses all parts of the query and maintains semantic equivalence. Think about how you could measure whether the response makes progress toward fully answering the user’s question. Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'."

**Strengths:**  
1. **Clarity of role:** You clearly define the agent as a “meticulous QA evaluation agent,” which sets the mindset.  
2. **Focus on coverage and relevance:** You explicitly ask the agent to consider whether all parts of the user query are addressed.  
3. **Semantic equivalence:** The prompt emphasizes that the retrieved answer must be semantically equivalent to a correct answer, not just superficially related.  
4. **Simplicity of output:** Restricting the response to “Yes” or “No” ensures consistent formatting.

**Limitations / Weaknesses:**  
1. **Vagueness on “full resolution”:** Phrases like “fully resolves” and “all parts of the query” may be interpreted differently by the model. A more operational definition could improve consistency.  
2. **No explicit handling of partial answers:** The prompt doesn’t clarify how to treat answers that partially answer the question or include minor inaccuracies.  
3. **No explicit instruction to check factual correctness:** Semantic equivalence is mentioned, but the prompt doesn’t stress fact-checking or logical consistency.  
4. **No guidance on reasoning or justification:** The model is told to output “Yes” or “No,” but it’s not guided to internally reason before deciding. This can sometimes reduce accuracy in zero-shot scenarios.  

**Characteristics inferred from the example:**  
- The model needs to recognize **paraphrasing of the question** (“In which year did the first version of Civilization come out?” → “When did the computer game Civilization first come out?”).  
- The model needs to **verify the factual correctness** of the retrieved answer (“1991”).  
- The model needs to **ignore superficial similarity** and focus on whether the answer fully satisfies the query.

### **Suggestions for Improving the Prompt**

To make the prompt more robust for zero-shot evaluation, consider:

1. **Define what “fully resolves” means explicitly:**  
   For example, specify that the answer must:  
   - Answer all explicit parts of the user query.  
   - Be factually accurate and relevant.  
   - Avoid adding irrelevant or misleading information.  

2. **Add internal reasoning steps:**  
   Even if the output is “Yes” or “No,” instruct the model to **think step-by-step internally** to assess completeness and correctness.  

3. **Include paraphrase understanding:**  
   Emphasize that the retrieved question may be **worded differently** from the user query but should still cover the same intent.  

4. **Clarify treatment of partial answers:**  
   Specify that **any missing or incorrect information should be considered “No”**.  

5. **Optional:** Encourage focus on measurable criteria:  
   E.g., whether all entities, dates, numbers, or actions mentioned in the query are addressed in the answer.  

---

### **Improved Zero-Shot Prompt Example**

Here’s a revised version based on the above insights:

```
You are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine if a retrieved question-answer pair fully resolves the user's query. 

A QA pair fully resolves a query if:
1. The retrieved question captures the same intent as the user query, even if phrased differently.
2. The answer directly addresses all parts of the user query.
3. The answer is factually correct and does not contain misleading information.
4. No relevant part of the query is omitted or ignored.

Think carefully about each of these criteria before responding. Respond only with 'Yes' if the QA pair fully resolves the query, otherwise respond 'No'.
```

**Why this is better:**  
- Provides **explicit criteria** for “fully resolves.”  
- Emphasizes **paraphrase understanding and factual accuracy**.  
- Helps the model internally reason systematically.  
- Maintains the **clean “Yes/No” output** for zero-shot evaluation.  

---

If you want, I can create an **even more optimized prompt** specifically designed to **maximize zero-shot correctness across diverse QA types**, including multi-part questions, numeric questions, and reasoning-heavy queries, while still being concise.  

Do you want me to do that next?Prompt to get Refinement after critique, from LLM:

These conditions involve maintaining an alkaline pH between 8 and 10 and temperatures between 20°C and 25°C . Additionally, a delicate balance in the quantities of key ions, such as magnesium, phosphate, and ammonium, is necessary for the success of the method .\n\nThe reaction rate of struvite crystallization can be controlled by adjusting the pH according to the change in phosphate concentration . As the phosphate concentration increases and the solution pH rises (e.g., from 8.6 to 9.08), the reaction rate also increases rapidly . When the phosphate concentration increases from 20 to 100 mg/L, the reaction rate increases from 70.46 to 396.65 mg·L−1·h−1 . However, it is important to note that too high a pH can affect the purity of the struvite .\n\nFurthermore, better crystallization rates are obtained when magnesium concentrations surpass the stoichiometric ratio . This means that the process can be modified through the addition of deficient ions, such as magnesium, to achieve the desired precipitation of struvite .\n\nOutput 'Yes' if the retrieved QA is a perfect match, otherwise 'No'.\n\n[Answers]:\n"}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

Let\'s carefully analyze your current 3-shot in-context example set and suggest improvements, considering **diversity, complexity, and relevance** to make them more effective for your QA evaluation task. I’ll go example by example.  \n\n---\n\n### **Example 1 Analysis**\n**Current Example:**  \n- **User Query:** I am trying to determine the normal yearly wage scale for a Concierge position within Diamond Resorts International?  \n- **Retrieved QA:** salary for a concierge with diamond international → The average Diamond Resorts International salary ranges from approximately $20,000 per year for Concierge. However, the average hourly pay for a Concierge at Diamond Resorts International ranges from approximately $9.00 per hour to $40.00 per hour.  \n- **Answer:** true  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Clear numerical/quantitative information.  \n- Matches the user query closely; fully answers the question.  \n- Good example of a factual, data-based query.  \n\n**Weaknesses / Improvements:**  \n1. **Precision in phrasing:** The retrieved question is slightly less formal (“diamond international” vs. “Diamond Resorts International”), which might slightly mislead the QA evaluation agent. Consider normalizing capitalization and specificity.  \n2. **Complexity:** This example is very straightforward (a single factual lookup). Adding an example where the retrieved QA contains partial or tangential information could improve diversity.  \n3. **Answer format:** Currently, it’s marked as "true" (which should be "Yes" per the prompt instruction). Ensure consistency with the prompt’s instruction to avoid confusion.  \n\n**Suggested Improvement:**  \n- Slightly tweak retrieved QA to introduce a minor mismatch (e.g., only hourly rate, missing annual salary) to allow the agent to judge “No” as well.  \n\n---\n\n### **Example 2 Analysis**\n**Current Example:**  \n- **User Query:** Whom does the legendary cartoon industry figure employing the artistic skills of Fred Carter represent?  \n- **Retrieved QA:** Who was an American cartoonist and publisher who had Fred Carter working for him? → Jack Thomas Chick was an American cartoonist and publisher who had Fred Carter working for him.  \n- **Answer:** true  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Captures an interpretive/semantic paraphrasing match between user query and retrieved QA.  \n- Slightly more complex than the first example because of the “represent” → “who employed” paraphrase.  \n\n**Weaknesses / Improvements:**  \n1. **Language complexity:** The original user query is phrased unusually (“Whom… represent?”). It might confuse the evaluation agent. A simpler semantic paraphrase could improve clarity.  \n2. **Diversity:** Currently, all examples are factual. This could be enhanced by including at least one opinion-based or procedural QA pair.  \n3. **Answer formatting:** Again, should be “Yes” instead of “true” per your prompt.  \n\n**Suggested Improvement:**  \n- Keep semantic/paraphrase complexity but clarify awkward wording in the user query.  \n- Example: User Query: “Which cartoonist employed Fred Carter?”  \n- Retrieved QA: “Jack Thomas Chick employed Fred Carter as an artist.”  \n- Answer: Yes  \n\n---\n\n### **Example 3 Analysis**\n**Current Example:**  \n- **User Query:** How might the addition of non-HA antigens affect the reliability of HA-based vaccines?  \n- **Retrieved QA:** What is the disadvantage of inclusion of non-HA antigens to HA based vaccines? → The disadvantage of inclusion of non-HA antigens to HA-based vaccines is that it can reduce efficacy and limit repeated use due to the generation of immunological memory to these components.  \n- **Answer:** true  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Good example of technical/scientific content.  \n- Shows a case where semantic paraphrasing between question and retrieved question matters.  \n- Introduces slightly more complex reasoning than purely factual answers.  \n\n**Weaknesses / Improvements:**  \n1. **Complexity:** This is a very narrow, scientific technical example. To ensure generalizability, you could add an example from a different domain (e.g., procedural “how-to” or conceptual “why” questions).  \n2. **Relevance to evaluation task:** While useful, all three current examples are technically answered (all “Yes”). For a robust few-shot prompt, including a clear “No” example is essential for the agent to learn contrast.  \n3. **Answer formatting:** Again, “Yes” vs “true.”  \n\n**Suggested Improvement:**  \n- Add a negative case: e.g., User Query: “How does X happen?”  \n- Retrieved QA: “X is unrelated to Y…” → clearly does **not** answer the question.  \n- Answer: No  \n\n---\n\n### **Overall Suggestions for the 3-Shot Set**\n1. **Add diversity of answer types:** Include at least one example that is opinion-based, procedural, or partially answered to challenge the QA evaluation agent.  \n2. **Add both “Yes” and “No” examples:** Right now all answers are “true.” The prompt specifically requires the agent to decide Yes/No, so a negative example is critical.  \n3. **Vary domain & complexity:** Current set has factual, biographical, and scientific—good—but could include one more procedural or abstract reasoning example.  \n4. **Ensure formatting consistency:** Use “Yes”/“No” instead of “true/false.”  \n5. **Subtle differences in QA matching:** Introduce slight mismatches (e.g., partial info, paraphrasing differences) to teach the agent to critically evaluate semantic equivalence.  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can **draft a revised 3-shot example set** following all these improvements that would maximize the effectiveness of your prompt. This will include:  \n\n- 1 straightforward factual “Yes”  \n- 1 complex paraphrase/semantic match “Yes”  \n- 1 clear “No” example with partial/irrelevant information  \n\nDo you want me to do that next?\nBased on the above information, use all of it smartly and diligently to carefully create new set of 3, which follow these suggestion and improvements.\nMake sure to output each example wrapped with <START> and <END>.\n\nNew examples should follow this format strictly:\n\n[Question] followed by question part of the example\n[Answer] followed by the all the steps of logic reasoning statements related to answer. The final answer as "<ANS_START>[answer]<ANS_END>"\n\nFor Example: <START>\n\n[Question] User Query: Is it common knowledge that Euphorbia invades foreign environments?\nRetrieved Question: Yes, euphorbia is considered invasive as it has the ability to thrive and spread aggressively outside its natural range and can crowd out native species.\nRetrieved Answer: 7\n[Answer] false\n\n<END>\n\n[New Examples]:\n'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

I’ll evaluate each example individually on **clarity, coverage, complexity, diversity, and compatibility with the overall set**:  \n\n---\n\n### **Example 1**  \n**[Question]** User Query: What is the average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International?  \nRetrieved Question: What is the salary range for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International?  \nRetrieved Answer: The average salary for a Concierge at Diamond Resorts International ranges from approximately $20,000 per year. However, the average hourly pay ranges from $9.00 to $40.00 per hour, depending on experience.  \n**[Answer]** <ANS_START>Yes<ANS_END>\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- ✅ Strengths:  \n  - Concrete numerical data makes the QA pair clearly resolvable.  \n  - Good semantic overlap between “average yearly salary” and “salary range.”  \n- ⚠ Weaknesses / Improvements:  \n  - The retrieved question asks for a **range**, not the average, which could create a subtle mismatch. A more precise retrieved question might be: “What is the average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International?”  \n  - Including both average and range in the answer might confuse a strict “Yes/No” QA judgment, as a judge could argue the retrieved question does not perfectly match the user query.  \n\n**Suggested improvement:**  \n- Replace the retrieved question with one that explicitly asks for the **average** salary to reduce ambiguity.  \n- Keep the answer concise and aligned with the user query focus.  \n\n---\n\n### **Example 2**  \n**[Question]** User Query: Which cartoonist employed Fred Carter as an artist in the comic industry?  \nRetrieved Question: Who was an American cartoonist who employed Fred Carter as an artist?  \nRetrieved Answer: Jack Thomas Chick was an American cartoonist who employed Fred Carter as an artist.  \n**[Answer]** <ANS_START>Yes<ANS_END>\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- ✅ Strengths:  \n  - Clear one-to-one match between query and retrieved QA.  \n  - Simple, factual knowledge-based question.  \n- ⚠ Weaknesses / Improvements:  \n  - Low complexity: very straightforward retrieval.  \n  - Semantic shift: “which cartoonist” vs “who was an American cartoonist” is fine, but adding “in the comic industry” in the retrieved question could make it perfectly aligned.  \n\n**Suggested improvement:**  \n- Adjust the retrieved question to explicitly mention “in the comic industry” to reduce even minor ambiguity.  \n- Could add a more complex question variant (e.g., asking for multiple cartoonists if there are multiple relevant answers) to increase diversity in example difficulty.  \n\n---\n\n### **Example 3**  \n**[Question]** User Query: How does the inclusion of non-HA antigens affect the effectiveness of HA-based vaccines?  \nRetrieved Question: What is the disadvantage of including non-HA antigens in HA-based vaccines?  \nRetrieved Answer: The inclusion of non-HA antigens in HA-based vaccines can reduce their effectiveness by causing an immune response to the non-HA components, potentially limiting the vaccine’s repeated use.  \n**[Answer]** <ANS_START>Yes<ANS_END>\n\n**Analysis:**  \n- ✅ Strengths:  \n  - Introduces scientific reasoning and causal relationship.  \n  - Adds diversity and complexity to the set compared to the factual/numerical examples.  \n- ⚠ Weaknesses / Improvements:  \n  - The retrieved question asks for a **disadvantage**, not the direct effect. While the answer aligns, a strict semantic judge could argue mismatch.  \n  - Could slightly reword the retrieved question to directly ask about **effectiveness impact** rather than “disadvantage.”  \n\n**Suggested improvement:**  \n- Retrieved question: “How does including non-HA antigens affect the effectiveness of HA-based vaccines?”  \n- Keep the answer unchanged, as it directly addresses the effect.  \n\n---\n\n### **Overall Set Analysis**  \n\n**Strengths:**  \n- Shows diversity: factual (salary), entity-based (cartoonist), and scientific reasoning (vaccine effectiveness).  \n- Covers simple to moderately complex queries.  \n\n**Weaknesses / Improvements:**  \n1. **Semantic precision:** Some retrieved questions don’t exactly match the user query. A more strict alignment would improve clarity for QA judgment.  \n2. **Diversity in complexity:** Only one high-complexity example (vaccine). Could include:  \n   - Multi-part questions (e.g., “What are the symptoms and treatment options for X?”).  \n   - Opinion-based vs factual questions to test “Yes/No” judgment.  \n3. **Format consistency:** Ensure all retrieved questions mirror the wording of user queries as closely as possible.  \n\n**Suggested enhanced 3-shot set (conceptually):**  \n1. Numerical/factual (salary, price, date) → improve semantic alignment.  \n2. Entity-based/factual (people, organizations) → add slight complexity or multi-entity retrieval.  \n3. Scientific reasoning/cause-effect → keep as is, adjust retrieved question for exact effect alignment.  \n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can **rewrite your 3-shot set fully optimized** to maximize diversity, complexity, and semantic alignment while keeping the “Yes/No” evaluation task perfectly clear. This would give you a ready-to-use few-shot prompt.  \n\nDo you want me to do that?\nBased on the above information, use all of it smartly and diligently to carefully create new set of 3, which follow these suggestion and improvements.\nMake sure to output each example wrapped with <START> and <END>.\n\nNew examples should follow this format strictly:\n\n[Question] followed by question part of the example\n[Answer] followed by the all the steps of logic reasoning statements related to answer. The final answer as "<ANS_START>[answer]<ANS_END>"\n\nFor Example: <START>\n\n[Question] User Query: How long ago did Australians gain control over the island nation of Nauru?\nRetrieved Question: When was Nauru first colonized by Australia?\nRetrieved Answer: Based on the given context, Nauru was first colonized by Australia in 1914 .\n[Answer] false\n\n<END>\n\n[New Examples]:\n'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

The goal is to create a well-rounded and varied example set that will help the model evaluate the quality of QA pairs in a wide range of scenarios, while maintaining clear and consistent logic.\n\nLet\'s break down each example and offer suggestions for improvement:\n\n---\n\n### Example 1:\n**[Question]** User Query: *What is the average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International?*  \n**Retrieved Question:** *What is the average salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International?*  \n**Retrieved Answer:** *The average yearly salary for a Concierge at Diamond Resorts International is approximately $20,000 per year.*  \n**[Answer]** Yes\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Clarity & Precision:** The query asks specifically for *yearly salary*, and the retrieved question omits the word "yearly," which could be a potential source of confusion. Ideally, the question should match the original query\'s phrasing more closely to avoid ambiguity.\n  \n  **Improvement:**  \n  - Change the retrieved question to: *What is the average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International?*\n\n- **Complexity & Diversity:** This example deals with a simple factual question regarding salary. It could be made more complex by adding contextual information or slight variations, such as asking for salary ranges or factors affecting the salary, which would help assess how well the model handles these kinds of nuanced queries.\n  \n  **Improvement:**  \n  - Example of a more complex query: *What is the average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International, and how does it compare to the industry average?*\n\n---\n\n### Example 2:\n**[Question]** User Query: *Which cartoonist employed Fred Carter as an artist in the comic industry?*  \n**Retrieved Question:** *Who was the American cartoonist who employed Fred Carter as an artist in the comic industry?*  \n**Retrieved Answer:** *Jack Thomas Chick was the American cartoonist who employed Fred Carter as an artist in the comic industry.*  \n**[Answer]** Yes\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Clarity & Relevance:** The retrieved question adds the word "American," which does not seem to be necessary and could potentially alter the meaning of the original query. The user may not specifically care about the nationality of the cartoonist.\n  \n  **Improvement:**  \n  - Remove the "American" from the retrieved question to align more closely with the original query. The user may not have asked for this extra detail.\n  - Revised question: *Who employed Fred Carter as an artist in the comic industry?*\n\n- **Complexity & Diversity:** This example focuses on a straightforward factual question. To increase complexity and evaluate the model\'s ability to handle ambiguity, you could introduce more complex scenarios, such as questions about the *role* of Fred Carter or the *timeline* of his work with the cartoonist.\n\n  **Improvement:**  \n  - Example of a more complex query: *Which cartoonist employed Fred Carter as an artist, and what was the nature of Fred Carter\'s contributions to the comic industry?*\n\n---\n\n### Example 3:\n**[Question]** User Query: *How does the inclusion of non-HA antigens affect the effectiveness of HA-based vaccines?*  \n**Retrieved Question:** *How does including non-HA antigens impact the effectiveness of HA-based vaccines?*  \n**Retrieved Answer:** *Including non-HA antigens in HA-based vaccines can reduce their effectiveness by causing an immune response to the non-HA components, potentially diminishing the vaccine\'s overall efficacy.*  \n**[Answer]** Yes\n\n#### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **Relevance & Precision:** The retrieved question does a good job of paraphrasing the original query. However, the term "non-HA antigens" might be unfamiliar to some, and the phrasing of the answer could be more precise in detailing how it affects the vaccine\'s effectiveness. The answer could also benefit from mentioning the *mechanism* behind how these antigens cause immune responses.\n  \n  **Improvement:**  \n  - To enhance precision, rephrase the answer to include the mechanism: *Non-HA antigens can cause an immune response that diverts attention away from the HA component, potentially leading to a less focused immune response and reducing the vaccine\'s overall effectiveness.*\n\n- **Complexity & Diversity:** This example is more scientifically complex, but you can expand it by adding variations, such as asking about the effects in different vaccine types or in specific populations.\n\n  **Improvement:**  \n  - Example of a more complex query: *How does the inclusion of non-HA antigens affect the effectiveness of HA-based vaccines in elderly populations?*\n\n---\n\n### General Recommendations for the Example Set:\n1. **Diversity of Topics**:  \n   You have a strong variety of topics (salary, comic industry, and scientific/medical), but you can introduce more diversity by including examples related to different fields, such as technology, entertainment, history, or geography. This will ensure that the model is well-rounded in handling various subject matter.\n\n   **Example Suggestions**:  \n   - *What are the most popular tourist attractions in Paris?* (travel & tourism)  \n   - *What are the key features of the latest iPhone model?* (technology)  \n   - *Who were the main leaders during the American Civil War?* (history)\n\n2. **Varying Complexity**:  \n   Introduce examples of varying complexity. Some queries should be simple factual questions, while others should involve more detailed explanations, comparisons, or scenarios. This will help assess how well the model handles different types of answers.\n\n   **Example Suggestions**:  \n   - Simple factual: *What is the capital of Canada?*  \n   - Complex: *How did the development of artificial intelligence impact global economies in the 21st century?*\n\n3. **Maintain Consistency in Answer Evaluation**:  \n   Your current answers are consistent in evaluating whether the retrieved answer fully resolves the user\'s query. However, ensure that all examples are clear and not overly complex, so that the model is able to distinguish between correct and incorrect QA pairs easily.\n\n   **Example of a “No” answer**:  \n   - User Query: *What are the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine?*  \n   - Retrieved Question: *What are the common side effects of the flu vaccine?*  \n   - Retrieved Answer: *Common side effects of the flu vaccine include sore arm, mild fever, and fatigue.*  \n   - Answer: *No* (since the retrieved question is not aligned with the user’s query regarding COVID-19 vaccine side effects)\n\n---\n\n### Final Thoughts:\n- **Clarity and Alignment**: Ensure the question in the retrieved QA pair closely matches the user’s original query, including phrasing and any details specified.\n- **Diversity of Topics**: Aim for a wide range of domains to ensure robustness.\n- **Complexity and Variability**: Incorporate both simple and complex scenarios to test the model\'s ability to evaluate different kinds of answers.\n\nBased on the above information, use all of it smartly and diligently to carefully create new set of 3, which follow these suggestion and improvements.\nMake sure to output each example wrapped with <START> and <END>.\n\nNew examples should follow this format strictly:\n\n[Question] followed by question part of the example\n[Answer] followed by the all the steps of logic reasoning statements related to answer. The final answer as "<ANS_START>[answer]<ANS_END>"\n\nFor Example: <START>\n\n[Question] User Query: Where do respiratory viruses mainly target and reproduce?\nRetrieved Question: Where do the respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate?\nRetrieved Answer: The respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate in the airway epithelial cells.\n[Answer] true\n\n<END>\n\n[New Examples]:\n'}], 'model': 'gpt-4o-mini', 'temperature': 0.0}}

You are a meticulous QA evaluation agent. Your task is to determine if a retrieved question-answer pair fully resolves the user’s query. Consider whether the QA pair addresses all parts of the query and maintains semantic equivalence. Think about how you could measure whether the response makes progress toward fully answering the user’s question. Respond only with 'Yes' or 'No'.  


[Question] User Query: What is the average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International, and how does it compare to the industry average?
Retrieved Question: What is the average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International, and how does it compare to the industry average salary for concierges?
Retrieved Answer: The average yearly salary for a Concierge at Diamond Resorts International is approximately $20,000 per year, which is below the industry average of $25,000 for concierges in similar resorts.
[Answer] [Improved Reasoning Chain]:  

1. **Identify the user query components:** The user asks two things:  
   - The average yearly salary for a concierge at Diamond Resorts International.  
   - A comparison of that salary to the industry average for concierges.  

2. **Analyze the retrieved question:** The retrieved question mirrors the user query exactly, including the comparison to the industry average salary. This ensures semantic alignment with the original query.  

3. **Analyze the retrieved answer:**  
   - The answer provides a specific figure for Diamond Resorts International concierges ($20,000 per year).  
   - The answer explicitly compares it to the industry average ($25,000 per year).  
   - The answer clearly indicates the direction of the comparison (“below the industry average”), which addresses the second part of the user query.  

4. **Check completeness:**  
   - Both components of the query are fully addressed.  
   - There is no missing information, ambiguity, or misalignment with the user’s intent.  

5. **Check correctness of semantic match:**  
   - The retrieved QA pair provides precise, direct, and relevant information for both the user’s question about the specific company salary and the comparison to the industry standard.  

6. **Decision:** Since the retrieved QA completely and accurately resolves the user query, it satisfies the criteria for a correct response.  

**Final Answer:** Yes <ANS_START>true<ANS_END>

[Question] User Query: How does the inclusion of non-HA antigens in HA-based vaccines affect their overall effectiveness in elderly populations?
Retrieved Question: How does including non-HA antigens in HA-based vaccines affect their effectiveness in elderly populations?
Retrieved Answer: Including non-HA antigens in HA-based vaccines can reduce their effectiveness in elderly populations by causing an immune response that may not be fully directed toward the HA component, resulting in a diminished immune response and lower vaccine efficacy.
[Answer] [Improved Reasoning Chain]:  

1. **Compare the user query and retrieved question**: Both ask about the effect of including non-HA antigens in HA-based vaccines on their effectiveness in elderly populations. The retrieved question is semantically equivalent to the user query, addressing the same target population (elderly) and the same vaccine composition (HA-based vaccines with non-HA antigens).  

2. **Analyze the retrieved answer for relevance**: The retrieved answer states that including non-HA antigens can reduce effectiveness in elderly populations by diverting the immune response from the HA component, leading to diminished immune response and lower vaccine efficacy.  

3. **Match answer to the query components**: The user query asks specifically about the effect of non-HA antigens on overall effectiveness in the elderly. The retrieved answer directly addresses this by explaining the mechanism (immune response diversion) and the outcome (reduced vaccine efficacy).  

4. **Check for completeness**: The answer fully addresses the question by linking non-HA antigen inclusion to immune response behavior and vaccine effectiveness in the target population, leaving no part of the query unanswered.  

5. **Semantic equivalence verification**: Both the retrieved question and answer preserve the meaning of the original user query and provide a complete, scientifically plausible response.  

6. **Conclusion**: Since the retrieved QA pair fully resolves the user query, the correct judgment is **Yes**. <ANS_START>true<ANS_END>
